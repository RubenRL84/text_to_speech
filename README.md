# Text to Speech Converter with GitHub Actions

Welcome to the **Text to Speech Converter** repository! üó£Ô∏èüîä

This project automatically converts the content of a `Text.txt` file into an audio file (`audio.mp3`). The conversion happens whenever you update the `Text.txt` file and push the changes to the `master` branch. The process is fully automated with GitHub Actions.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

```
.github/workflows/            # GitHub Actions workflow files
Text.txt                     # The text file to be converted
text_to_speech.py            # The Python script for text-to-speech conversion
README.md                   # This file
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Setup

This project relies on the following technologies:

- **Python** (for the conversion script)
- **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** for generating audio
- **GitHub Actions** for automation

Make sure you have Python installed locally if you want to test the script manually:

```sh
pip install gtts
```

Then, run the script:

```sh
python text_to_speech.py
```

## üöÄ GitHub Actions Workflow

The project is set up with a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- **Trigger:** The workflow runs on a push or pull request to the `master` branch.
- **Steps:**
  - Checkout the repository
  - Install required Python packages (like `gTTS`)
  - Run the `text_to_speech.py` script to generate the audio file
  - Upload the `audio.mp3` file as an artifact

### üõ†Ô∏è `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` (simplified view)

```yaml
name: Python application

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install modules
        run: pip install gTTS
      - name: Run a Python script
        run: python text_to_speech.py
      - name: Archive audio file
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: audio-output
          path: audio.mp3
```

## üìò Usage

1. **Edit `Text.txt`:** Add or modify the content you want converted to audio.
2. **Commit and Push:** Push your changes to the `master` branch.
3. **Wait for the Action:** GitHub Actions will run the script automatically.
4. **Download the Audio:** Once the workflow completes, download the `audio.mp3` file from the workflow artifacts.

## üìñ Purpose of the Project

- **Automation:** Explore CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Experiment with audio generation using Python.
- **Learning:** Understand how to build practical projects with automation.

This repository is a great starting point for exploring automation, text-to-speech, and Python scripting! üõ†Ô∏è

Happy coding! üöÄ
